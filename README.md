### Spotify Playlist Explorer

An initial pass at a visualization for exploring a Spotify playlist's audio features.

Code prepared as an in-class demo of small multiples, so lacks any sort of distracting refinement.

Throwing it up here as a form of public motivation to make it something published and interesting.

Can brush over dots, representing tracks, which are highlighted in other multiples. Interesting part is the pretty basic "Play the highlighted songs" API call, which effectively (almost) lets you play only a thematic subset of a playlist (like high danceability + high valence songs).
